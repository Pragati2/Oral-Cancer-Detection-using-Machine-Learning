# Oral Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

A deep learning-based image classification model that detects oral cancer using X-ray images. Built using VGG-16 architecture and trained on a dataset of over 6,500 labeled images. Achieved 91% test accuracy, outperforming traditional ML baselines by 35%.

## üîç Problem Statement
Oral cancer is a significant health concern, especially in developing regions. Early detection can drastically improve survival rates. This project leverages convolutional neural networks to automate the detection of cancerous tissues from medical images.
